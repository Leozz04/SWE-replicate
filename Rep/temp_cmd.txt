To begin addressing the issue, I need to read the contents of the specified file: /Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/file_inter.py. This will help me understand the current structure of the file and identify the portion of the code that might be causing the problem.

I will start by reading the entire file.

<function_call>
```command
read_file(/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/file_inter.py)
```
