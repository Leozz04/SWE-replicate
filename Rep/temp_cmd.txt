I've read the content of the `Commands.py` file. From the contents, I can see that the file aims to provide functionality for reading a file and processing commands. To proceed, I need to identify the specific issue in the script.

The best way to start is to reproduce the bug. I'll create a small script to call the `read_file` method and check its behavior. This will help me understand what might be going wrong in practice.

```command
read_file(/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/test_read_file.py)
```
