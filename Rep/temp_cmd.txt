I've reviewed the `Commands.py` file, and I need to replicate the issue before proceeding. To do that, it is essential to look for any specific scripts in the repository that reproduce the bug or error. I'll check the contents of the directory `/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/` to see if any such script exists.

<function_call>
```cmd
search_dir(/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/)
```
