The first step in solving the issue with the `Commands.py` file is to understand its contents. By inspecting the code, we can identify the part causing the problem and then work on fixing it. I'll start by reading the content of the file.

```command
read_file(/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/Commands.py)
```

I've read the content of the `Commands.py` file. From the contents, I can see that the file aims to provide functionality for reading a file and processing commands. To proceed, I need to identify the specific issue in the script.

The best way to start is to reproduce the bug. I'll create a small script to call the `read_file` method and check its behavior. This will help me understand what might be going wrong in practice.
