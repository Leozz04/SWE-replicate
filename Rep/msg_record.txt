To address the issue in the given Python script located at `/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/Commands.py`, I will follow a systematic approach:

1. **Read the Content of the File**: I need to understand what the script does and identify any potential issues.
2. **Locate Specific Issues if Mentioned**: Often, the bug might be specific to certain lines or functions within the file.
3. **Replicate the Bug**: Use any given or inferred reproducible steps.
4. **Fix the Bug**: Based on observations, make necessary changes.
5. **Verify Fix**: Test the modified script to ensure the bug is resolved.

First, I'll start by reading the content of the file to understand its structure and functionality.

<function_call>
```command
read_file("/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/Commands.py")
``` 
Considering the given task, the first step is to review the content of the `Commands.py` file. This will help us understand the context and functionality of the script. By doing so, we can identify the source of the issue and follow up with a plan.

I'll start by reading the content of the `/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/Commands.py` file.

<function_call>
```command
read_file("/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/Commands.py")
```
</function_call> 
<thought>
First, I'll start by trying to understand the content of the `Commands.py` file mentioned. This will help me assess what functionalities it implements and if thereâ€™s any obvious bug in the script.
  
<function_call>
```command
read_file(/Users/Leo/Documents/AI_Agent/SWE-replicate/Rep/Commands.py)
```
